# ```Kickstarter_Analysis_Challenge_Module1``` <br/>
Kickstarting with Excel


## __Overview of Project__ <br/>
1.	Download file and open with Excel for analysis
2.	Use formulas and apply filters
3.	Use pivot table to interpret data
4.	Creating visualizations of the data


## Purpose<br/>
In current project we had the goal to analyze how different Kickstarter campaigns fared in the relation to their launch date and their goals and use the findings to help Louise with her play Fever fundraising<br/>
## Analysis and Challenges<br/>
#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date<br/>
Analyzing the theater outcomes based on launch date, we can see that the projects launched in May were the most successful (almost 100%)<br/>
While the most failed were the fundraisers that began in March and September

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals<br/>
Analyzing the plays outcomes based on goal, we can notice that the most successful were fundraisers under $5000 or around $40000 (up to 80%). While the biggest failures were $5,000 to $35,000<br/>
In general, the trend is clearly visible – the larger the goal, the less successful the campaign is. And vice versa, the smaller the goal, the higher the probability of a successful campaign

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered<br/>
During the analysis of database, we encountered some data limitations, such as limited period data or lack of data about the patron<br/>
## Results


#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?<br/>
1.	The most successful theater project happens in May<br/>
2.	Beside the cancellations, the least successful theater project happens in March<br/>
#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?<br/>
The outcomes based on goals show that the projects that are successful are the ones with less than $5000 goals and once the goal reaches $20000, the change of failure is greater<br/>
#### What are some limitations of this dataset?<br/>
The database has limited data<br/>
To more accurately analyze the outcomes of fundraising campaigns and identify more criteria for success, we can analyze data about patron – gender, age, occupation, etc<br/>
#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?<br/>
A chart that will determine the timeline between the launch and the deadline underlining the success or failure of the outcome<br/>
