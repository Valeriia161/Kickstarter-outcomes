# Kickstarter-outcomes.
## Analysis of Kickstarter outcomes based on the different factors.
## In current project we had the goal to analyze how different Kickstarter campaigns fared in the relation to their launch date and their goals and use the findings to help Louise with her play Fever undraising.
### We did some research based on data such launch date, certain categories (such as theaters and plays), as well as goals. We reviewed all the data related to the study and identified a pattern that affects the result. Each campaign ended either successfully, was failed or was cancelled. 
### Analyzing the theater outcomes based on launch date, we can see that the projects launched in May were the most successful (almost 100%). While the most failed were the fundraisers that began in March and September.
### Analyzing the plays outcomes based on goal, we can notice that the most successful were fundraisers up to $5000 or around $40000 (up to 60%). While the biggest failures were over $50000.
### In general, the trend is clearly visible – the larger the goal, the less successful the campaign is. And vice versa, the smaller the goal, the higher the probability of a successful campaign.
## We can conclude that the most successful months to start fundraising are May-July. And the most successful goal is either up to $5000 or from $35000 to $40000.
## During the analysis of database, we encountered some data limitations, such as limited period data or lack of data about the patron. 
## To more accurately analyze the outcomes of fundraising campaigns and identify more criteria for success, we can analyze data about patron – gender, age, occupation, etc.
